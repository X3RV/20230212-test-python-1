# Test-20230212-1
Test repo illustrating some interesting test programs and/or concepts.  Primarily Python Colaboratory.

Started: 2023/02/12

Update:  2023/02/18 
Under development.  Added clarification to the top level comment and breif initial documantation for 20230218 13-1.ipyynb - X
NOTE: Add that file example later

Last Update:  2023/02/22 - The basics of 20230218 13-1.ipyynb are complete.  Though it's super rough still.




***********************
20230218 13-1.ipyynb 
This will be a program that is a match game featuring a grid 8 x 8 using the letters Q, R, S, T, U.  
They will be randomly placed in the grid.  The user can swap letters that are next to one another.  
A minimum match of 3 causes the letters to match, award points, move the existing letters down, and 
replace the empty slots with new random letters.
This continues until a score goal is reached.

* This is illistrating several differant concepts that are important (as well as being a nice begining program of slightly higher than average begining complexity)
- use of the import function (in the syntax of from)
- use of functions (and the definition program)
- example of top-down design (with loop cycle main area)
- calling functions
